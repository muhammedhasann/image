# MERN AI Image Generation App

This project is a full stack web application that uses Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, React.js, and Tailwind to create and display images generated by OpenAI's DALL-E model. The app allows users to enter a text description of an image and see the corresponding image generated by the DALL-E model.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization using JWT and bcrypt
- CRUD operations for images and user profiles using MongoDB and Mongoose
- Image generation using OpenAI's DALL-E API
- Image display and pagination using React and Tailwind
- Responsive design
